      <p>This graph explores education over 8 years period.
        The data takes different age group, ranging from 15 years to 85+ years
        for both male and female. The data takes the highest percentage of year 12 graduates (from differnet age group)
        from all the location in New South Wales.
        <br></br><b> Results </b>
          Observable from the graph, it is clear that there females have a higher amount of graduates initially.
          However the steep and also steady decline over the new 2 years is quite significant.
          Both results for males and females are fairly similar in trends where they both drop towards 2008-2009 but eventually begins inclining.
          This data possibly expresses a successful change in the education system however, although it was effective for many years,
          the lack of newer change ultimately caused the incline to drop, even though the incline was increasingly increasing.
          Some could argue the increase of technology was to be complimented for the increase of graduates and ultimately the change in polarity of increase/ decrease.</p>

        <p>The pie graph displays the larger number of female graduates compared to male. Although interestingly,
          the NSW population of the male to female ratio is not that large of a difference.
          There are currently 3369591 males and 3404658 females in NSW which makes the ratio 1 to 1.01.
          Hence this pie chart can be conclusive that Females have a higher success in education.</p>
